# Ramp-Type-Digital-Voltmeter-DVM-
Ramp Type Digital Voltmeter (DVM) A digital voltmeter based on the ramp type conversion principle. The circuit measures input voltage by generating a linearly increasing ramp signal and comparing it against the unknown input. This method provides accurate and reliable voltage readings using basic analog and digital components.
